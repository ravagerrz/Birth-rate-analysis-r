## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}


library(nutshell)
data(births2006.smpl)

# First, list the data for the first 5 births. 
head(births2006.smpl)

# Next, show a bar chart of the frequencies of births according to the day of the week of the birth.
births.dayofweek = table(births2006.smpl$DOB_WK) #Goal of this variable is to speed up the calculations
barplot(births.dayofweek, ylab="frequency", xlab="Day of week", col = "darkred", main= "Number of births in 2006 per day of the week")

# Obtain frequencies for two-way classifications of birth according to the day of the week and the method of delivery.
births.methodsVdaysofweek = table(births2006.smpl$DOB_WK,births2006.smpl$DMETH_REC) 
head(births.methodsVdaysofweek,7)
barplot(births.methodsVdaysofweek[,-2], col=heat.colors(length(rownames(births.methodsVdaysofweek))), width=2, beside=TRUE, main = "bar plot of births per method per day of the week")
legend ("topleft", fill=heat.colors(length(rownames(births.methodsVdaysofweek))),legend=rownames(births.methodsVdaysofweek))

# Use lattice (trellis) graphs (R package lattice) to condition density histograms on the values of a third variable. 
library(lattice)

# The variable for multiple births and the method of delivery are conditioning variables. 
# Separate the histogram of birth weight according to these variable.
histogram(~DBWT|DPLURAL,data=births2006.smpl,layout=c(1,5),col="black", xlab = "birth weight", main = "trellis plot of birth weight vs birth number")

histogram(~DBWT|DMETH_REC,data=births2006.smpl,layout=c(1,3),col="black", xlab = "birth weight", main = "trellis plot of birth weight vs birth method")

# Do a box plot of birth weight against Apgar score and box plots of birth weight by day of week of delivery. 
boxplot(DBWT~APGAR5,data=births2006.smpl,ylab="birth weight",xlab="AGPAR5", main="Boxplot of birthweight per Apgar score")

boxplot(DBWT~DOB_WK,data=births2006.smpl,ylab="birth weight",xlab="Day of Week", main="Boxplot of birthweight per day of week")

# Calculate the average birth weight as a function of multiple births for males and females separately. 
# Use the “tapply” function, and for missing values use the “option nz.rm=TRUE.” 
listed = list(births2006.smpl$DPLURAL,births2006.smpl$SEX)
tapplication=tapply(births2006.smpl$DBWT,listed,mean,na.rm=TRUE)
barplot(tapplication,ylab="birth weight", beside=TRUE, legend=TRUE,xlab="gender", main = "bar plot of average birthweight per multiple births by gender")
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
